1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
Now that you had a chance to see how

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,590
RGB-D cameras work and play with the data a little bit,

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,330
we're going to dig deeper into how to make the most out of these feature rich data sets.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,825
First, we'll talk about sensor calibration, which is to say,

5
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:15,190
calibrating how your camera sees the world around

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,255
it in terms of geometry, distortion, and noise.

7
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:21,390
Understanding your camera's calibration is crucial to

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,010
understanding how you've measured data represents your actual physical surroundings.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,650
After that, we'll talk about filtering your data.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,965
With 3D point clouds,

11
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:33,870
the majority of the data actually corresponds to unwanted background objects or

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,880
other things that must be filtered out before you can

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,770
perform object detection or recognition.

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,570
Finally, we'll cover segmentation which is the process of breaking

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,450
a filtered point cloud data into meaningful pieces

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,710
each of which correspond to an object or class of objects in your data.

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,390
You'll get a chance to work with the Random Sample Consensus or RANSAC algorithm which

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,920
is a powerful way of performing

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,480
segmentation in the presence of noise or outlier senior data.

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,000
Great. Let's dive right in the calibration then.
