1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
Any and every sensor,

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,405
whether related to perception or not,

3
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:07,090
measures some physical quantity either directly or indirectly.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,330
But these measurements often deviate from

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,875
the ground truth due to factors like noise and distortion.

6
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,210
This inconsistency can be attributed to

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,720
the measurement system itself or external factors.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,385
We can alleviate external noise,

9
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:23,550
to some extent, by using various filtering techniques.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,155
But to remove systematic inconsistencies,

11
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:29,390
we first need to understand their origin or the root cause.

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,330
First of all, let me make it clear that no sensor is perfect.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,580
We, humans, have flaws and so do the devices we create.

14
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,525
Two sensors from the same manufacturer may produce

15
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:43,124
slightly different results due to minor internal variations.

16
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:46,245
Many sensors show a change in response with changes

17
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:49,680
in weather conditions like temperature or humidity.

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,330
Moreover, some sensors drift naturally with time and, hence, are imprecise.

19
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,195
So, then, how do we deal with this mountain of

20
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:59,935
inconsistencies to obtain the best possible results?

21
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,310
The answer to that question is calibration.

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,300
Calibration at its core is the process of comparing two measurements,

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,260
a standard or ground truth and a measurement from the sensor being calibrated.

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,959
After the conversion is made,

25
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,695
we can adjust the sensor so that

26
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:17,800
its measurement matches the ground truth as closely as possible.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,310
Next, you will learn in detail about different types of

28
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,670
calibration and perform a calibration of your RGB-D camera.
