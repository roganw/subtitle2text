1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
At this point you should have a sense of what type of

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,250
3D perception sensors are used in robotics,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,620
along with some of their advantages and disadvantages.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,000
As I mentioned before among all the different 3D sensors,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,990
RGB-D cameras stand out as providing the best of both worlds.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,540
With the best of RGB-D camera that provides,

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,415
a feature rich color video stream,

8
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:21,930
and an active depth sensor,

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,250
that provides a relatively accurate per pixel depth map for any given scene.

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,319
In addition RGB-D cameras are typically cheaper than other 3D sensors like lidars,

11
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:32,465
time of flight cameras,

12
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,185
or even stereo cameras.

13
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:38,270
Almost all RGB-D cameras have a USB based plug and play interface,

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,180
making them easy to use and accessible to hobbyists, and experts alike.

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,510
These sensors are perfect for applications

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,525
like indoor autonomous navigation on a mobile robot,

17
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:51,180
3-D workspace mapping with a robotic arm,

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,855
object detection and tracking,

19
00:00:52,855 --> 00:00:55,405
facial recognition and much more.

20
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:59,130
So let's explore 3-D perception techniques using RGB-D cameras.
