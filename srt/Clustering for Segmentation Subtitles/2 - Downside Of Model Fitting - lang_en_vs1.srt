1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,305
So far you have filtered your point cloud data and you wrote

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:06,920
a RANSAC plane-fitting algorithm to remove the table from your scene.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,280
Next you'll learn how to further segment the remaining data into meaningful pieces.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,674
From a technical perspective,

5
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:17,415
RANSAC can be used to fit a variety of shaped models like cylinders,

6
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:20,950
cubes or spheres; but in the scenario we're working with,

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,160
you have a cluttered environment with little to

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,055
no prior information about how many objects there may be in the scene.

9
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:28,410
It's very likely that many of

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,370
the tabletop objects may fit the same shape model as your target object.

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,170
For example, if your target object were a can of soda,

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,650
other cylindrical objects like a cup,

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,380
a bottle or a pen holder may induce

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,410
false positives if you were to rely solely on the RANSAC cylinder-fitting algorithm.

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,950
Not only that, but your scene has objects of various shapes.

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,195
If you were to model fit many shapes for removal,

17
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:55,280
you'd be processing the entire point cloud of data many times;

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
once for each model,

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,860
which is not at all optimal.

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,120
Instead we will now focus on other properties of our scene.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,380
Unlike a lighter or time-of-flight camera,

22
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:10,100
an RGB-D camera provides us with data which is rich in features like colors and texture.

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:16,000
In this lesson, you'll use these features to recognize the object you're looking for.
