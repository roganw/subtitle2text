00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
So now you have filtered your point cloud data and wrote

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,355
a RANSAC plane filtering algorithm to remove the table from your scene.

3
00:00:06,355 --> 00:00:10,940
However, thus far, you have been relying solely on object shapes to perform segmentation.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,578
That's right. Even though we've been dealing with point clouds,

5
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:17,100
your dataset still contains feature rich color information as well that can be

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,485
combined with your shape information to perform more complex segmentation tasks.

7
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:25,440
In this lesson, we'll be introducing a technique called Clustering that will

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,150
allow you to segment objects in your point cloud without having to assume a model shape.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,845
In essence, this technique will allow you to find points in

10
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:37,085
your data set that are clustered together based on particular features.

11
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:39,165
These clusters could be based on color,

12
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:42,870
position, texture or a combination of many features.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,880
Performing segmentation using clustering,

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,200
it gives you the freedom to discover

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,220
an arbitrary number of objects of any shape in your data.
